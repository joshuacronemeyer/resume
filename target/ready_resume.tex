    I Worked as a programmer on a 20+ developer Agile project for
    a well known e-commerce site.  The application had complex
    integration requirements, high traffic and performance needs,
    and as usual the deadline was ultra tight. Technologies included 
    Spring MVC and Mule ESB. %Nondisclosure agreements make it necessary
    %for me to put stuff like "well known company x" :( Even in comments.
    
    I Worked as a developer on a frontend equipment leasing application 
    for a well known manufacturer.  The project was a 10+ year old
    EJB application running on Weblogic.  With nearly 6000 class files
    it would even make someone who wrote the book on legacy code 
    (Michael Feathers) get sweaty armpits.  Add to that equation the 
    fact that the domain of leasing is particularly challenging and 
    you get the picture.  This project was a bear. %Martin fowler
    %talks about this project.  And hey!  He speaks fondly of it
    %http://martinfowler.com/bliki/NashvilleProject.html
    %I too get all choked up just thinking of our 25 minute
    %cruise build and the session beans.

    As part of a smaller Agile team for Inveneo (a nonprofit startup TW
    did pro bono work for) I was tech lead in charge of delivering 
    a build and test system for Ubuntu installer ISOs. This is the
    best project I've even been on just because the software was
    going to help bring technology to remote places in Africa.

    Another small Agile team I worked on delivered a reporting tool
    at an investment bank in London.  This was a small piece of a 
    much larger programme that was subsequently cancelled due to 
    a very difficult political situation within the company.  Even
    with the premature end of the project we delivered working software
    to the client.  Thanks XP! %We almost got to use why the lucky
    %stiff's 'shoes' as the GUI technology!

\section{OTHER}          
    I have presented at OSCON (twice), Open Source Bridge, Chicago
    Ruby User Group and the Chicago Python User Group.  I love Open 
    Source and have my own seldom used project called Shell-Sink.  
    I have also made minor contributions to Mocha, Debian-CD and 
    once had an idea rejected by the Rails team.
    %Ok, so I implemented migrations for Rails database fixtures, 
    %but then I realized that fixtures were just a bad idea to
    %begin with so eventually my friends talked me down from 
    %trying to get that included in rails core.  Thank goodness.

\section{SKILLS}          
    Linux, XP/Agile, General consulting, Having fun\\
    %I can't stand it when people throw every technology they have
    %ever heard of onto their skills section.

\section{PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES}          
    Java, Ruby, Python, Bash, Scala\\
    %Scala is a real stretch, since i'm just learning it, but hey
    %I'd like to write some scala for pay someday.
     
\section{JUST FOR FUN}          
    Avid Home Brewer, Baker, climber, and runner.\\
    %Seriously, this is one of the most important parts of a resume.
    %I'm waving my hands hoping the person reading it has a soul and
    %notices I have one too.
