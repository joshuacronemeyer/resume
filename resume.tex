    I Worked as a programmer on a 20+ developer Agile project for
    a well known e-commerce site.  The application had complex
    integration requirements, high traffic and performance needs,
    and as usual the deadline was ultra tight. Technologies included 
    Spring MVC and Mule ESB.
    
    I Worked as a developer on a frontend equipment leasing application 
    for a well known manufacturer.  The project was a 10+ year old
    EJB application running on Weblogic.  With nearly 6000 class files
    it would even make someone who wrote the book on legacy code 
    (Michael Feathers) get sweaty armpits.  Add to that equation the 
    fact that the domain of leasing is particularly challenging and 
    you get the picture.  This project was a bear.

    As part of a smaller Agile team for Inveneo (a nonprofit startup TW
    did pro bono work for) I was tech lead in charge of delivering 
    a build and test system for Ubuntu installer ISOs. This is the
    best project I've even been on just because the software was
    going to help bring technology to remote places in Africa.

    Another small Agile team I worked on delivered a reporting tool
    at an investment bank in London.  This was a small piece of a 
    much larger programme that was subsequently cancelled due to 
    a very difficult political situation within the company.  Even
    with the premature end of the project we delivered working software
    to the client.  Thanks XP!
