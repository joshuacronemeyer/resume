This resume PDF generating codebase is no longer maintained. Just browse my github and linkedin if you're interested. https://github.com/joshuacronemeyer and https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-cronemeyer/

My resume.  To build run:
rake

You must have latex installed and dvipdf

The beauty of this system, aside from version control and being able to fork my own resume is that I can put comments into my resume.  Easter egg!
